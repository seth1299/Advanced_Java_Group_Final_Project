How to play the game:

!!! THE GAME ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS !!!

1) You need Java version 17.0.10 installed on your machine. All archived downloads can be found on: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html

Direct Download link for Windowsx64: https://download.oracle.com/java/17/archive/jdk-17.0.10_windows-x64_bin.exe

2) Once you have the correct version of Java 17.0.10 installed, all you need to do is click on the "runGame" Windows Command and that's it! If any security pop-ups show up,
click "run anyway" or some similar option.
