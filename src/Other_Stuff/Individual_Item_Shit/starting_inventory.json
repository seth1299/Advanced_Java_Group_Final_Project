The man is making a coy smile and holds a finger up to his lips as if to signify that he's supposed to be secretive. To the left of the man stands a young-looking caucasian woman wearing a silver dress and silver galoushes that have high heels. In the corner of the picture is a handwritten message that says \"Yeah, baby!\". You can't fathom why you have this drawing, but you feel compelled to keep it.",
